# Homy Project
Solving all the _little_ problems

### Teamplates

Find templates in:
    /public/{name of the html file}.html

General template can be found in
    public/index.html

When generating your own views use this file. Reference the stylesheets and javascripts via:
    <script src="@{'public/javascripts/YOUR_JS'}"... or
    @{script 'public/javascripts/YOUR_JS'} or
    <script src="@{'public/stylesheets/YOUR_JS'}"...

### Notes on Dev process

*1* Please check all your code before you commit. If it does not run it does not help

*2* If you do not know how to _merge_, merge with somebody else together, otherwise your code might get lost
